This project is an Arduino-based system designed to detect fire using temperature and smoke sensors. By integrating the LM35 and MQ-2 sensors, the system continuously monitors for signs of fire. When fire is detected (temperature exceeds 50Â°C or smoke levels rise), it activates visual and audible alarms, sends SMS alerts with GPS coordinates using a GSM module, and displays the status on an LCD screen. Additionally, a servo motor is used to control physical responses, like unlocking emergency exits.

The system provides real-time status updates, ensuring immediate action can be taken in case of fire. The project is designed to enhance safety protocols by combining sensor technology and communication systems in an easily deployable manner.
