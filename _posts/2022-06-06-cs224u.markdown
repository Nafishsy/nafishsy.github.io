The course was the pivoting point as it shifted my interests from software to machine learning.  
This project investigates the relationship between music and mental health, specifically in individuals experiencing anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD. Using the `mxmh_survey_results.csv` dataset, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification is employed to categorize musicâ€™s perceived effects as improving, worsening, or having no effect.

I implement KNN classification and analyze the results, achieving promising results. The research explores how different music characteristics correlate with mental health conditions.
