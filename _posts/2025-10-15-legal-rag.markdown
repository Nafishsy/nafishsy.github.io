Architected high-throughput ingestion pipeline for 50,000+ legal precedents achieving 98% layout fidelity in complex dual-column Bengali PDFs using fine-tuned YOLOv8 and recursive semantic chunking. Engineered retrieval system evaluated on the Ragas framework, attaining <strong>0.95 Faithfulness</strong> and <strong>0.92 Context Recall</strong>; reduced hallucinations by 40% via hybrid search (Dense + BM25). Deployed fault-tolerant architecture with Redis semantic caching and continuous evaluation loops.
