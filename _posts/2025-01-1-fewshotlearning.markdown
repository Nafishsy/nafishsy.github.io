Developed a novel few-shot learning architecture requiring only 5% of available training data while achieving exceptional generalization. On full-shot training, outperformed existing solutions with metrics of <strong>92.72% Dice coefficient</strong> and 86.58% Jaccard Index (IoU). Innovated an optimized Medical Transformer (MedT) architecture combining HMSDM encoders with hybrid attention mechanisms, multi-scale feature extraction, and bottleneck transformers to optimize segmentation on small retinal datasets (FIVES dataset).
