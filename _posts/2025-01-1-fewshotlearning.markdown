In this project, I explore few-shot learning techniques applied to retinal vessel segmentation. Currently, I have achieved a Dice coefficient of 0.86, approaching the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) of 0.89, achieved without using few-shot learning. This showcases the effectiveness of few-shot learning in improving segmentation accuracy for medical imaging, especially when limited labeled data is available.
