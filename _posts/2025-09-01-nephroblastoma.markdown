Developing a dual-task deep learning system for nephroblastoma (Wilms' tumor) detection and semantic segmentation using 35,000+ 2D grayscale CT images. Implemented advanced segmentation models (DeepLabV3 with ResNet-50 backbone) optimized using combined Dice Loss and Binary Cross-Entropy. Achieved superior tumor localization with <strong>90.81% Dice score</strong> and <strong>96.64% Sensitivity</strong>, demonstrating high reliability for clinical staging in pediatric oncology.
