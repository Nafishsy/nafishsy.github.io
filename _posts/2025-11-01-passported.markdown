Developing an AI-powered MVP utilizing Latent Diffusion Models to transform unconstrained input images into standardized, full-frontal pose passport photos. Implementing advanced pose-control mechanisms via ControlNet to ensure strict alignment compliance while maintaining high facial identity fidelity. Deployed the inference pipeline on HuggingFace Spaces for automated professional ID photo generation.
