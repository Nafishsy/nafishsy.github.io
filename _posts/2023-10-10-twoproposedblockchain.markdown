Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems serve as centralized platforms to streamline and automate organizational functions, promoting efficiency and collaboration. However, traditional centralized databases in ERP systems raise significant security concerns. Blockchain technology presents an effective alternative by providing immutable and decentralized data with enhanced security.

This study explores two methods for securing data management in ERP systems: organizing distributed information using the Ralph Kimball data model and optimizing individual blocks through Database Sharding. The paper thoroughly examines both methods, evaluating their benefits and limitations, and aims to patch security vulnerabilities in ERP systems to safeguard sensitive data and mitigate risks.

The research contributes to the ongoing effort to enhance ERP system security and provides insights into leveraging blockchain technology to improve data integrity and access control.
