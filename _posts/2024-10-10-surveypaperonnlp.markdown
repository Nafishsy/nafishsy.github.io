Human–Agent Interaction (HAI) is evolving rapidly, and integrating deep learning techniques into Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds immense potential. This paper delves into the complexities of HAI, shedding light on the significant role of deep learning in shaping communication between humans and agents. Moving beyond a focus on sentiment analysis, the study spans various facets of HAI, including dialogue systems, language understanding, and contextual communication. 

We systematically explore the applications, algorithms, and models that define the current landscape of deep learning-based NLP in HAI. Additionally, the research examines common pre-processing techniques, datasets, and customized evaluation metrics. We provide insights into the benefits and challenges of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in HAI, along with a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art.

The manuscript concludes with a discussion on the challenges facing HAI and suggests future research directions. This study offers a balanced understanding of models, applications, challenges, and future directions in deep learning-based NLP in HAI, focusing on recent contributions in the field.
